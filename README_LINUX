MASSIVE Launcher for Linux

The Linux binary distribution of the MASSIVE Launcher doesn't require any
installation. After extracting, the "massive" binary file can be run using:

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./massive

If you wish to run MASSIVE Launcher using an icon on your desktop, or using a
menu item, you will need to copy the "MASSIVE Launcher.desktop" file to your 
~/Desktop/ and adjust the executable and icon paths specified in 
"MASSIVE Launcher.desktop" to wherever you choose to install MASSIVE Launcher, 
(/opt/MassiveLauncher/ is recommended). If using a custom installation 
directory, you will need to update the LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in the 
MassiveLauncher/massiveLauncher.sh wrapper script.

If you want to make the MASSIVE Launcher for all users, you can copy
"MASSIVE Launcher.desktop" to /usr/share/applications/ and copy the icon files
from MasiveLauncher/icons/ into appropriate subdirectories within 
/usr/share/icons/hicolor/
