CVL ADMINISTRATOR

This is a vey raw wxPython GUI prototype which is similar to the cvl-fabric-launcher, 
except that it is used to launch virtual machine instances, instead of being used
to launch VNC sessions on existing virtual machine instances.

Initially it has been implemented using the Python boto API, but this API has some
serious limitations when used with OpenStack (as distinct from Amazon Web Services),
so some other OpenStack APIs may be used in combination with boto, see:
