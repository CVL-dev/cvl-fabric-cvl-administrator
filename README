MASSIVE LAUNCHER
================

MASSIVE Launcher is an attempt to offer MASSIVE users an easier login method,
beginning with Mac OS X users.  Currently Mac OS X users have to install
TurboVNC, only to find that there is no double-clickable TurboVNC application
in their Applications folder, so they have to run it from the command-line 
after creating an SSH tunnel.  MASSIVE Launcher provides a double-clickable
GUI launcher for MASSIVE users, which creates the SSH tunnel automatically, 
using the Python pexpect library, and then calls TurboVNC to launch the MASSIVE
Desktop.  This allows the user to launch the MASSIVE Desktop without having to
use the command-line.

BUNDLING THE PYTHON SCRIPTS INTO A MAC OS X APPLICATION

On Mac OS X, the launcher app can be built using:

python create_massive_bundle.py py2app

The core code of the launcher is in the massive.py script, and can be run
with "python masive.py". The create_massive_bundle.py script is used with 
py2app to create the MASSIVE.app application bundle. 

The create_massive_bundle.py script can be used to specify the application
name, the icon file, the version number, and other attributes to be included
within MASSIVE.app/Contents/Info.plist

MASSIVE LAUNCHER VERSION NUMBER

The version number of a Mac OS X application is listed in its 
ApplicationName.app/Contents/Info.plist file.  However, the MASSIVE Launcher
application needs to be able to check its version number programmatically
(preferably using a platform-independent method), so that it can inform the 
user if an upgrade is required.  For this reason, the version number is 
recorded in the massive_launcher_version_number.py script, so that it can be 
read by both the create_massive_bundle.py script, used by py2app to build
MASSIVE.app/Contents/Info.plist, and by the massive.py application.

PYTHON VERSION

A 32-bit version of Python is required to use wxPython. It is best to install
Python from python.org, rather than trying to use a pre-installed version
bundled with the operating system. James uses python-2.7.3-macosx10.3.dmg from 
Python.org.

WXPYTHON VERSION

The wxPython version you use must match the Python version being used 
(e.g. 2.7).  James uses wxPython2.8-osx-unicode-2.8.12.1-universal-py2.7 from 
http://wxpython.org/download.php 

ICON

The MASSIVE.icns icon file is for the Mac OS X operating system only. 
It was created using the free Img2icns application. http://www.img2icnsapp.com/
There is also a built-in Mac OS X application, Icon Composer. It used to live
in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder, or the /Developer/Applications/ folder.
Now you have to install Xcode first (from the App Store), then launch Xcode, and from the Xcode menu, choose "Open Developer Tool". The image used to create
the icon was taken as a screenshot (cmd-shift-4) from the MASSIVE website. The
white background was then made transparent, by using Gimp 2.8's 
"Color to Alpha..." menu item in the "Colors" menu. 

The create_massive_bundle.py script can be used to specify the icon file
(MASSIVE.icns), which will be included in MASSIVE.app/Contents/Info.plist by
the py2app module. The MASSIVE.icns file will be copied into
MASSIVE.app/Contents/Resources/ by the py2app module.
